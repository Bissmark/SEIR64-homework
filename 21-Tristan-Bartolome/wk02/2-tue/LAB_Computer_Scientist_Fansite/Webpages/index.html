            <p>Yukihiro Matsumoto (まつもとゆきひろ, Matsumoto Yukihiro, born 14 April 1965), also known as Matz, is a Japanese computer scientist and software programmer best known as the chief designer of the Ruby programming language and its original reference implementation, Matz's Ruby Interpreter (MRI).

<!-- Requirements
At least 3 pages (example: biography, trivia, hometown)
At least 1 Google Font
Whatever HTML and CSS you desire
Keep your code clean and DRY
Start working with semantic elements: http://html5doctor.com/lets-talk-about-semantics/
No Javascript! Even if you know how to use jQuery, see how far you can push this with pure HTML + CSS
Don't worry about responsiveness -- desktop resolution is fine
Your research should aim to reveal at least two things about each person:
Why Joel admires them
Something Joel doesn't already know about them
Optional extras
Experiment with http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/
Record and embed a short podcast or vlog about your favourite scientist
Try embedding other media (YouTube or Vimeo video, Soundcloud)
Try embedding a Google map (for their hometown and/or alma mater) -->
